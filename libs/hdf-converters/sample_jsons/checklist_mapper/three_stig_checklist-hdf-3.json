It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.\\n\\nThreat modeling can optimize application security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.\\n\\nThe lack of threat modeling will potentially leave unidentified threats for attackers to utilize to gain access to the application. To execute a threat model you should do the following:\\n\\n- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.\\n\\n- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.\\nE.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.\\n\\n- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.\\n\\nCountermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.\\n\\nRefer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.\\n\\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling\",\n  \"iaControls\": \"\",\n  \"checkContent\": \"This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work.\\n\\nIf the organization operating the application is not doing the development or is not managing the development of the application, the requirement is not applicable.\\n\\nReview the threat model document and identify the following sections are present:\\n\\n- Identified threats\\n- Potential vulnerabilities\\n- Counter measures taken\\n- Potential mitigations\\n- Mitigations selected based on risk analysis\\n\\nReview the identified threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures.\\nCountermeasures could include implementing application firewalls or IDS/IPS and configuring certain IDS filters.\\n\\nReview the application documentation.\\nVerify the architecture and components of the application match with the components in the threat model document.\\nVerify identified threats and vulnerabilities are addressed or mitigated and the ISSO and ISSM have reviewed and approved the document.\\n\\nIf the described threat model documentation does not exist, this is a finding.\",\n  \"fixText\": \"Establish and maintain threat models and review for each application release and when new threats are discovered.

Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, this persistence allows the web application developer to provide a robust and customizable user experience.\n\nHowever, if a web application stores user authentication information within a persistent cookie or other temporary storage mechanism, this information can be stolen and used to compromise the users account.\n\nLikewise, HTML 5 provides the developer with a client storage capability where application data larger than the 4K cookie size limit can be stored on the local client.  While this can be beneficial to the developer, this is considered insecure storage and should not be used for storing sensitive session or security tokens.  A cross site scripting attack can put this data at risk.\n\nWeb applications must clear sensitive data from files and storage areas on the client when the session is terminated.",

If prompted by the browser to save the user ID and password (decline to save the user ID and password), this is a finding. \n\nLog out of the application and close the browser. Reopen the browser and examine the stored cookies. The cookies displayed should be related to the application website.\n\nThe procedure to view cookies will vary according to the browser used. Some modern browsers are making use of SQLite databases to store cookie data so use of a SQLite db reader/browser may be required.\n\nOpen the cookies related to the application website and search for any identification or authentication information. While authentication information can vary on a per application basis, this is most often specified as \"username=x\", or \"password=x\".\n\nIf the web application prompts the user to save their password, or if a username or password value exists within a cookie or within local storage locations, even if hashed, this is a finding.\n\nThe application may use means other than cookies to store user information.

The testing must cover all aspects and components of the application architecture.  If an application consists of a web server and a database, then both components must be tested for vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nVulnerability assessment tests normally utilize a combination of specialized software called application vulnerability scanners as well as custom scripts and manual tests.  In some instances, multiple tools are required in order to test all aspects of application features, functions and architecture.  The vulnerability scanner is typically configured to communicate with the application through the user interface or via an applications communication port.  In addition to using automated tools, manual tests conducted from the OS console such as executing custom scripts or reviewing configuration settings for known vulnerabilities may also be included as part of the test.\n\nTesters will typically utilize application user test accounts in order to test application features and functionality such as adding content, executing queries and completing transactions. The vulnerability testing software utilizes user actions and access as well as a list of known security vulnerabilities in order to detect and identify weak security controls or misconfigurations that could potentially be manipulated by the user or create a security vulnerability.\n\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 for 2013 includes the following top issues that should be tested.  The site is available by pointing your browser to https://www.owasp.org. \n\nA1 Injection\nA2 Weak authentication and session management\nA3 XSS\nA4 Insecure Direct Object References\nA5 Security Misconfiguration\nA6 Sensitive Data Exposure\nA7 Missing Function Level Access Control\nA8 Cross Site Request Forgery\nA9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\nA10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards\n\nThe OWASP top 10 are categories of tests that can be applied to most but not necessarily all applications and are provided as an example of what to test for.  Scanning tools include a multitude of tests that fall under these categories but may refer to these tests by a different name.\n\nTesting must be conducted on a periodic basis while the application is in production and subsequent to system changes to ensure any changes made to the system do not introduce new security vulnerabilities.",

Although web and SQL applications are included as examples and are the prevalent types of applications, this requirement is not intended to be limited to just the aforementioned application architectures.   Ensure test results are provided from all testing tools employed during vulnerability testing.\n\nIf high risk security vulnerabilities are identified in the scan results, request subsequent test results that indicate the issues have been fixed or mitigated.\n\nIf the high risk issues identified in the report have not been fixed or mitigated to a level accepted by the ISSO and the ISSM, or if the application administrator cannot produce vulnerability security testing results that cover the range of application functionality, this is a finding.",

If passwords are stored in clear text, they can be plainly read and easily compromised.\n\nIn many instances, verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash.  \n\nA more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random SALT value as follows:\n\nH0 = H(pwd, H(salt))\nHn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))\n\nWhere n is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. Hn is stored, along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares Hn with the stored Hn.\n\nA SALT is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically-strong random value.  \n\nAnother method used is utilizing a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC).  HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key.  The key must be protected as with any private key.\n \nApplications must only store passwords that have been cryptographically protected.",

To protect data integrity during transmission, the application must implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of all transmitted information. All transmitted information means that the protections are not restricted to just the data itself. Protection mechanisms must be extended to include data labels, security parameters or metadata if data protection requirements specify. Modern web application data transfer methods can be complex and are not necessarily just point-to-point in nature. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and RESTFUL web services allow for XML-based application data to be transmitted in a manner similar to network traffic wherein the application data is transmitted along multiple servers' hops. In such cases, point-to-point protection methods like TLS or SSL may not be the best choice for ensuring data integrity and alternative data integrity protection methods like XML Integrity Signature protections where the XML payload itself is signed may be required as part of the application design. Overall application design and architecture must always be taken into account when establishing data integrity protection mechanisms. Custom-developed solutions that provide a file transfer capability should implement data integrity checks for incoming and outgoing files.

Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nAbsence of input validation opens an application to improper manipulation of data. The lack of input validation can lead immediate access of application, denial of service, and corruption of data.\n\nInvalid input includes presence of scripting tags within text fields, query string manipulation, and invalid data types and sizes.\n\nWhen an application validates input, it will only execute provided input after it has evaluated the input, validated the input and determined the data is in an expected format, and content is not extraneous or malformed.\n\nComprehensive application security testing and code reviews are required to ensure the application is not vulnerable to input validation vulnerabilities.\n\nApplication security code reviews should be conducted during the development phase to find and address input validation errors.

Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.\n\nBuffer overflows can manifest as stack overflows, heap overflows integer overflows and format string overflows. Each type of overflow is dependent upon the underlying application language and the context in which the overflow is executed.\n\nInteger overflows can lead to infinite looping when loop index variables are compromised and cause a denial of service.  If the integer is used in data references, the data can become corrupt. Also, using the integer in memory allocation can cause buffer overflows, and a denial of service.  Integers used in access control mechanisms can potentially trigger buffer overflows, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. \n\nAlmost all known web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to buffer overflows. Proper validation of user input is required to mitigate the risk.

For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary.

Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as \"fuzz testing\". Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.\n\nMany vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications. All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.\n\nDue to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications. Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment.\n\nIt is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested. In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the website and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator. Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base. A code review requires complete code base access and is normally performed by the development team.\n\nIf vulnerability testing is not conducted, there is the distinct potential that security vulnerabilities could be unknowingly introduced into the application environment.\n\nThe following website provides an overview of fuzz testing and examples:\n\nhttp://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing",

To execute a threat model you should do the following:\n\n- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.\n\n- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.\nE.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.\n\n- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.\n\nCountermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.\n\nRefer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling",
